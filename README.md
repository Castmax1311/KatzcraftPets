With this plugin you can interact with your tamed animals!

Note: For all interactions except /givepet, you must be within a block radius of one block of your pet!

Note 2: For /givepet your pet needs a name

Commands for operators:
- You can tame an animal nearby (/tame)
- You can put a saddle directly on a horse in a two block radius (/saddle)

Commands for all:
- You can transfer your tamed pet to another player (/givepet [petname] [player])
- You can let your pet carry you (/ridepet)
- You can untame your animal nearby (/untame)
